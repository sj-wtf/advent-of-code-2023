# advent-of-code-2023

My text editor told me there was noeol in this file when I opened it for the first time, which is very much in the mood of the season. 

I'm going to try to do this year's advent of code. It's been years since I did one of these, but I feel like some of my skills are slipping away while I focus on others, so I'm going to give this a try and do my best to get every challenge done.
